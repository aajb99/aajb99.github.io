My name is Aaron Brown and I love working on data projectsâ€”everything from web scraping data from infinite online sources to exploratory data analysis and visualizations, feature engineering, regression analysis, machine learning and predictive analytics, and so much more. As you can see, there is plenty of potential in the fields of Statistics and Data Science, and I am set on exploring the extent of their power and relevance in the world. I hope you find my posts useful!

More about me: I am currently an undergraduate student at Brigham Young University majoring in Statistics with a Data Science Emphasis. I am planning to pursue a graduate education and perform research on Entity Resolution and optimal dataset convergeance. However, I am also interested in other research areas including Geospatial Analysis and Bayesian Hierarchical Models. I enjoy sports and I absolutely love working on sports-related data projects. In my free time, I enjoy being outdoors and doing outdoor activities, including hiking, skiing, mountain biking, pickleball, and golf.
