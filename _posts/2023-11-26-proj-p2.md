## Study Introduction

To reiterate from my last post: in recent decades, Utah and surrounding states in the U.S. have been experiencing a long-term drought. For the western region of the U.S., one of the primary sources of these conditions may be the continuously-changing patterns in snow supply (primarily mountain snow). For communities in this region, winter snowpack is one metric used to determine the quality of the upcoming year when it comes to precipitation levels. This metric, of course, determines more than just simple annual precipitation—it also alludes to the success of an economy fractionally built upon agriculture and recreational activities, including golf, water sports, and skiing. Despite the surgeance of this drought, if there is, truly, a steady decrease in snowpack, is it due to lowering levels of seasonal precipitation, or is it mainly due to shifting patterns of weather based on global warming trends, thus reducing snowpack via a shortened winter season? My study tackles this question and provides support for the latter claim—that Utah is experiencing more and more of a warmer winter season rather than a drier season. This is according to the data I have extracted from USDA sites as well as my analysis of such observations.

The observations were extracted from the USDA's [Air & Water Database](https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/nwcc/snow-course-sites.jsp?state=UT). The next sections discuss the results of my study, along with answers to the following: is there evidence of a decrease in seasonal snowpack, and if so, what evidence is there to attribute it to the ongoing drought versus irregular fluctuations in weather patterns due to global trends?


## Findings and Insights

My data extraction and wrangling methods can be found in my previous post, [Utah Snow Accumulation Study: Intro and Web Scraping Walkthrough](https://aajb99.github.io/2023/11/14/proj-p1.html). My finalized dataset includes monthly snowpack (e.g. "Jan" and "May") observations as well as the estimated Water Equivalence (e.g. "Jan (WE)" and "May (WE)") levels for each SNOTEL Site, and is ordered by "Water Year" or the observed year:
