## Study Introduction

To reiterate from my last post: in recent decades, Utah and surrounding states in the U.S. have been experiencing a long-term drought. For the western region of the U.S., one of the primary sources of these conditions may be the continuously-changing patterns in snow supply (primarily mountain snow). For communities in this region, winter snowpack is one metric used to determine the quality of the upcoming year when it comes to precipitation levels. This metric, of course, determines more than just simple annual precipitation—it also alludes to the success of an economy fractionally built upon agriculture and recreational activities, including golf, water sports, and skiing. Despite the surgeance of this drought, if there is, truly, a steady decrease in snowpack, is it due to lowering levels of seasonal precipitation, or is it mainly due to shifting patterns of weather based on global warming trends, thus reducing snowpack via a shortened winter season? My study tackles this question and provides support for the latter claim—that Utah is experiencing more and more of a warmer winter season rather than a drier season. This is according to the data I have extracted from USDA sites as well as my analysis of such observations.

The observations were extracted from the USDA's [Air & Water Database](https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/nwcc/snow-course-sites.jsp?state=UT). The next sections discuss the results of my study, along with answers to the following: is there evidence of a decrease in seasonal snowpack, and if so, what evidence is there to attribute it to the ongoing drought versus irregular fluctuations in weather patterns due to global trends?


## Findings and Insights

My data extraction and wrangling methods can be found in my previous post, [Utah Snow Accumulation Study: Intro and Web Scraping Walkthrough](https://aajb99.github.io/2023/11/14/proj-p1.html). My finalized dataset includes monthly snowpack (e.g. "Jan" and "May") observations as well as the estimated Water Equivalence (e.g. "Jan (WE)" and "May (WE)") levels for each SNOTEL Site, and is ordered by "Water Year" or the observed year:

I customized addtional factors, including a "Decade" variable in preparation for comparisons between subsets of data grouped by decade.

My main findings were prompted by certain correlation trends spotted in the following correlation heatmaps (grouped by month collected):

        }

            width: 380px; /* Set the width of your images */
            height: auto; /* Maintain aspect ratio */
        }

As it is depicted here, there is a general trend of decreasing correlation between the monthly snowpack/water equivalent factors with factors of time, including decade, water year, and year installed (refer to dashboard to observe other months). It may be interpreted that as the months progress into the later season (Spring months), levels of snowpack gradually shrink at larger rates as the decade variable and other time factors increase. This will be explored further, but additional relationships must be analyzed, such as elevation and location (Lat/Lon) with snowpack—strong correlations here would prove difficult to isolate and analyze the relationship between snowpack and time variables.

Out of these additional potentially-underlying factors of snowpack as time increases, I first took a look at the locations of these sites by year and by decade:

            margin-bottom: 10px; /* bottom margins */
        }

        img {
            width: 380px; /* Set the width of your images */
            height: auto; /* Maintain aspect ratio */
        }

        }

            width: 380px; /* Set the width of your images */

The geo-scatterplots can be used to determine whether or not the SNOTEL Sites are evenly-spread across the state—it is, more or less, a metric indicating how well each year or decade "represents Utah". The above plots show the sites that are in use for the given year; for the decade of 1880, it is observed that from the first year, operating sites are fairly-distributed throughout the state. This decade is perhaps the most lopsided, but from end-to-end it is representative of the state overall (one reason for comparing data grouped by decade rather than by year). Additionally, I compared the decades of 1980 and 2020, where the purple indicates which sites were used in 1980, and red indicates the sites used in 2020—because of overlap, the second plot is used to determine which sites from 1980 were also used in 2020. The results show that these two decades are comparable in representing the state (decades in between show similar patterns). Also, for the 1980 decade, I included the years 1978 and 1979 which were the first years SNOTEL tech was used, and the 2020 decade includes years 2020-2023.

After determining that for each decade, location is, more or less, evenly distributed, I proceeded to analyze elevation to see whether or not the sites used in each decade shared a similar pattern not only of two-dimensional location, but also with altitude:

<img src="{{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/elev_hist.png" alt="" style="width:500px;"/>

This provides evidence that across decades, the elevation distribution for SNOTEL Sites is comparable. It can also be seen from the correlation heatmaps that while the relationship between elevation and installment year is somewhat distinguishable, the elevation by decades (and elevation by observed year) relationships are relatively miniscule, and arguably neutral.

The final check before comparing decade subsets by their snowpack levels was determining whether or not the relationship between snowpack/water equivalence and elevation stayed consistent for each month across different decades. If the regression slopes and patterns for the month of May between decades were alarmingly different, for example, we may need to be concerned about the nature of snow across elevation levels changing for one decade compared to others—this may include changes in water content in snow at certain altitudes or in certain regions of Utah, etc. If it stays consistent, then the "snow type" (nature of water equivalence) is roughly the same across decades.

The scatterplot matrix depicts the regression slopes for each month as similar, and slope computations indicated that they are nearly equivalent. Thus, across decades, snowpack levels will indicate, more or less, the same relationship with water equivalence.

Lastly, I ran the following EDA models to determine the distributions of snowpack level based on certain decade subset combinations:

            margin-bottom: 20px; /* bottom margins */
        }

        img {
            width: 400px; /* Set the width of your images */
            height: auto; /* Maintain aspect ratio */
        }
