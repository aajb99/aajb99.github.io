## Setting up an environment for Python and the Matplotlib library

* The first step to using Matplotlib in your data analysis is to set up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python and its libraries. Such environments include Visual Studio Code, Pycharm, Jupyter Notebook, etc. Because this tutorial will cover specific tools in Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization, it will not cover the initial steps to set up an environment and get started with Python.

* To find help in setting this up, I suggest looking at [Pycharm Setup](https://www.guru99.com/how-to-install-python.html), [VS Code Setup](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial), or other sources on setting up an environment for coding in Python.

* If you have your environment all set up and ready to go, then let's get started!



## Things to teach

* (look at matplotlib cheatsheet https://matplotlib.org/cheatsheets/_images/cheatsheets-1.png) make sure to inclue in plots tools such as markers, color wheel, and animations

* basic plots: imshow and contour

* advanced plot: violin plot

* maybe even a scale to show animation
